# CPepStabilizer

Computational pipeline for designing cyclic peptide binders that stabilize a protein dimer interface (PDB: 8ZCS).

The pipeline integrates AlphaFold2-based peptide design (ColabDesign), binding pocket prediction (AF2BIND), and molecular dynamics validation (AMBER).

**Code will be made available upon publication.**
